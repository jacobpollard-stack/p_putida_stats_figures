# The effect of soil moisture content on growth and hexadecane remediation 
# of *Pseudomonas putida* -------------------------------------------------------

## Experimental overview --------------------------------------------------------

### This study investigated how moisture level in the growth media affects
### the proliferation of saprophytic bacterium *Pseudomonas putida* and its
### ability to degrade hexadecane, a common hydrocarbon pollutant. We aim to
### advise on efficacy of *P. putida* to clean oil spills in environments with
### different aridity and humidity, such as the 2024 Libya pipe burst 
### (RÃ©daction Africanews, 2024) and the recent spills in the Ecuadorian Amazon
### (Shanna Hanbury, 2025).

### The growth was assessed by colony count on spot plates of a serial dilution
### of the soil suspended in $\frac{1}{4}$ strength Ringer solution
### (Ringer, 1883). 4 replicates were used per spot plate, with 3 plates
### per sample.

### The identity of the bacteria was confirmed by a series of tests, including
### oxidase testing, light microscopy, culturing on selective media, and PCR
### followed by gel electrophoresis.

## Description of data ---------------------------------------------------------

### The data for the mean colony counts has been processed to assess the
### CFU count per gram of dry soil. The data is located at '/Y3948024/R/data'.
### The data for the plate replicates and spot replicates for group 3 are in:
###    'cfu_per_g_d_soil_allgroups.xlsx' and
###    'cfu_per_g_d_soil_group3.xlsx' respectively. 
### The data for the plate replicates is ordered with each sheet being a
### different replicate, performed by a different group. Sheet 4 contains the
### CFU count for before incubation at the respective soil moisture content and
### contamination status.
### The data for the spot replicates was performed by group 3, and has n = 4
### for each sample.
### A gel electrophoresis image of the PCR products is located at
### 'Y3948024/R/data_gel_image'
